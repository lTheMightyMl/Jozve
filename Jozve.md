## Examples

### Weber Point

Given a collection of cities (assume on 2D plane) how can we find the location that minimizes the sum of distances to all cities?
`picture`
Let's denote the location of cities as $y_1, y_2, ..., y_n$.
Then we can find answer to our question by solving the optimization problem below:
$$\min} \sum^{n_{i1}||x-y_i||_2$$
