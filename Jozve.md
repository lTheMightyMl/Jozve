## Examples

### Weber Point

Given a collection of cities (assume on 2D plane) how can we find the location that minimizes the sum of distances to all cities?
`picture`
Let's denote the location of cities as $y_1, y_2, ..., y_n$.
Then we can find answer to our question by solving the optimization problem below:
$$\min_{x} \sum^{n}_{i=1}||x-y_i||_2$$

## How difficult is real-valued optimisation?

If we do not make any assumptions about the function $f:\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ , then it is impossible to find a global minimiser or maximiser in finite time. This is due to the fact that the value of the function at any one point does not reveal information about the function's behaviour at other points. As a result, we must know the function value for every point in $\mathbb{R}$, which simply takes infinite time because the set $\mathbb{R}$ is not finite. Even if we try to find a point at which the function's value is at most  $\epsilon$ distance
