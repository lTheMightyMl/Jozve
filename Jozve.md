### Weber Point

Given a collection of cities (assume on 2D plane) how can we find the location that minimizes the sum of distances to all cities?

Let's denote the location of cities as $y_1, y_2, ..., y_n$.
Then we can find answer to our question by solving the optimization problem below.
$$min_x \sum^{i}_{j}$$
